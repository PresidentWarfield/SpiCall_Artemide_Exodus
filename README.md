# SpiCall_Artemide_Exodus
Reversing of the C2C SpiCall | Artemide | Spartacus | initiator of Exodus Android Spyware Campaign

## Preamble
This a project created for **Malware Analysis** and **Research purpose**, and is the last step of a standard procedure (https://github.com/users/PresidentWarfield/projects/1) aimed **to research threat techniques and develop defenses**.

## Why those repositories are important
### Discover it yourself
- See how (e.g.) WhatsApp is intercepted on a phone: https://github.com/PresidentWarfield/SpiCall_Artemide_Exodus/search?p=2&q=whatsapp&unscoped_q=whatsapp
- See how (e.g.) C2C commands are executed on a phone: https://github.com/PresidentWarfield/SpiCall_Artemide_Exodus/search?q=CMD_NAME&unscoped_q=CMD_NAME

## Truncated for Privacy
Some piece of the code are truncated to avoid enticing unauthorized or unethical actions, but in any case the understanding of the code remains unchanged.

## Public Domain
The contents included into this repository have been released into the public domain since the original working application has been deliberately made public without restrictions (as a method of mass infection) through app stores.

## General Consideration
The code is a potpourri of already known instruction sets, but **has exposed both the producer and the victim to very high privacy risks**.

## Peculiarity
The MQTT protocol to manage the C2C operations

## For Governments
It would be enough to backtrack or simply use:
- App-Store / Developer token
  - To know the real email address / identity of the developer(s)
- The built in RSA key
  - To authenticate onto remote resources where all the data collected are stored indiscriminately
- The Fabric / CrashLytics credentials
  - To see which devices are / were infected
  
At the present day C2C (**5.** ...) servers are still up togheter with several stolen data repositories (**80.** ...).
